\section{Research question}
In this research project we will look at the possibilities of the 
\begin{quote}
Is it possible to monitor vital statistics of optical glass fiber cables on the 1625nm channel
\end{quote}

The words 'vital statistics' in the main research question has been kept deliberately vague because there are a multitude of statistics which could be monitored. 

WHICH STATISTICS WILL WE MONITOR?

Another question lies in the different types of singel-mode optical fiber. The ITU-T has created a set of standards which show what the wavelength coverage each type of singel-mode cable type is designed for \cite[p.~21]{refguide:2011} Although we shall not test every cable type for their specific 1625nm attenuation
